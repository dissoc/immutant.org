We just released Immutant 2.1.9. This release includes one fix:

* If you tried to call `.hashCode` on the Ring request, you would get
  a `NullPointerException`. This was caused by a [bug in Potemkin](https://github.com/ztellman/potemkin/issues/52),
  which we ported to our internal copy of Potemkin to resolve the
  issue.

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an integrated suite of [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
libraries backed by [Undertow] for web, [HornetQ] for messaging,
[Infinispan] for caching, [Quartz] for scheduling, and [Narayana] for
transactions. Applications built with Immutant can optionally be
deployed to a [WildFly] or [JBoss EAP] cluster for enhanced features. Its
fundamental goal is to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.
