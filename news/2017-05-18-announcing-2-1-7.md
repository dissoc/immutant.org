We just released Immutant 2.1.7. This release includes the following changes:

* We've upgraded our [Undertow] dependency to the latest stable
  version (1.4.14.Final) to resolve an issue with socket leaks when
  using async http responses/SSE.
* We've also upgraded or Ring dependency to 1.6.0.
* For HEAD requests, async channels now automatically close after the
  first `send!` call.

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an integrated suite of [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
libraries backed by [Undertow] for web, [HornetQ] for messaging,
[Infinispan] for caching, [Quartz] for scheduling, and [Narayana] for
transactions. Applications built with Immutant can optionally be
deployed to a [WildFly] or [JBoss EAP] cluster for enhanced features. Its
fundamental goal is to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.
