We just released Immutant 2.1.6. This release includes the following changes:

* Update to Ring 1.5.1 to address a [security vulnerability]. This
  vulnerability only affects applications that are running from the
  filesytem, not from an uberjar or war, so most users aren't affected.
* Remove our dependency on Potemkin. This was a common source of
  collision with other application dependencies, so we now use an
  internal copy of Potemkin under different namespaces so it doesn't
  conflict.
* A minor update of the version of tools.nrepl on which we depend
  (0.2.11 -> 0.2.12)

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an integrated suite of [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
libraries backed by [Undertow] for web, [HornetQ] for messaging,
[Infinispan] for caching, [Quartz] for scheduling, and [Narayana] for
transactions. Applications built with Immutant can optionally be
deployed to a [WildFly] or [JBoss EAP] cluster for enhanced features. Its
fundamental goal is to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.
