We just released Immutant 2.1.5. This release includes the following changes:

* Support for deployment to the newly-released [JBoss EAP 7][EAP7]
* A fix to allow you to use XA, `immutant.messaging/listen`, and a remote context together
* We no longer transitively depend on two different versions of jboss-logging
* Our Undertow dependency has been updated to 1.3.23.Final (from 1.3.0.Beta9) to fix issues with HTTP/2 in Chrome ([IMMUTANT-621])
* Other updates to our transitive depenencies, including:
  * java.classpath 0.2.2 -> 0.2.3
  * potemkin 0.4.1 -> 0.4.3
  * tools.nrepl 0.2.7 -> 0.2.11

We're especially proud to announce full support for [EAP7] on the day
of its official release, expanding our supported deployment options to
the following:

* Standalone
* [JBoss EAP] 6.4 and 7.0
* [WildFly] 8, 9, and 10
* Clojure 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9

Our comprehensive, automated integration test suite verifies all of
these whenever a change to Immutant is committed.

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an integrated suite of [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
libraries backed by [Undertow] for web, [HornetQ] for messaging,
[Infinispan] for caching, [Quartz] for scheduling, and [Narayana] for
transactions. Applications built with Immutant can optionally be
deployed to a [WildFly] or [JBoss EAP] cluster for enhanced features. Its
fundamental goal is to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.
