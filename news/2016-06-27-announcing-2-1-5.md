We just released Immutant 2.1.5.

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an integrated suite of [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
libraries backed by [Undertow] for web, [HornetQ] for messaging,
[Infinispan] for caching, [Quartz] for scheduling, and [Narayana] for
transactions. Applications built with Immutant can optionally be
deployed to a [WildFly] or [EAP] cluster for enhanced features. Its
fundamental goal is to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.
