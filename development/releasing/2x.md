title: Releasing a 2.x Release
layout: default
---


# Preparation

Currently, we build 2.x locally instead of via a CI job. To prepare:

1. Pull the latest changes from github
2. Verify that we're not using an incremental or snapshot of wunderboss
3. Verify the `:release-tasks` in `project.clj` are correct for this
   release.

# Releasing

    lein release

That should do the trick. If not, figure out why :)

The release task should push the commits and tags to github on success.

# Add the docs to immutant.org

1. checkout the release tag
2. run `lein docs`
3. `mkdir path/to/immutant.org/_2x_docs/<version>`
4. `cp -r target/apidocs path/to/immutant.org/_2x_docs/<version>/apidoc` 

# Release the project in JIRA

# Announce it

* Post it on `immutant.org`
* Notify `immutant-users@`
* Notify `the-core@`
* Notify `clojure@`
* Tweet.
* Set the /topic in `#immutant` IRC channel using ChanServ (if you can).
